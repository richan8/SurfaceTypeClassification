# Surface Type Classification
Surface type classification using Machine Learning techniques. The `.ipynb` notebook may be previewed here, or can be run on kaggle.

## Summary of Results

To conclude, two models have been developed for this project. The neural network model could be optimized further but as it currently stands, the Random Forest is providing a better classification and thus its scores are going to be reported.

## Final Scores
* With K-Fold CrossValidation: ~88%
* Accuracy of sample `y_test_new`: 95% (19/20 samples)
